Title: Large Scale Drawing
{I began developing my own drawing style in my A level year taking art. In my foundation year at Camberwell College of Art - I completed my first large scale drawing. In this drawing I experimented with perforating paper. I was very much drawn to the texture of what the back of the paper felt like and the abstract pattern that was created.}

{During my foundation year, I also began experimenting with a overhead projector. The overhead projector is a tool that I use to trace objects onto paper and reflect objects on the wall. The overhead projector also enables me to explore focus and scale.} {These large scale drawings very much explore my interest in color, texture, nature and mapping. When I create large scale works, I find myself thinking about the difference in scale between my body and the paper and the challenge that comes with creating work much larger than me.}
