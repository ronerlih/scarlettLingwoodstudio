{I was invited by Stefano Rabolli Pansera to do a two week residency at The Museum Of Contemporary Art Calasetta in Sardinia. In this two week residency I created a wall drawing. The wall drawing consisted of circular drawings repeated on a 8ft wall approximately.} 
{When I created this piece, I was very much drawn to the sound of the pencil marking the wall.} 
{Following on from the residency, I continued to collaborate with Stefano, Marina, Tankboys and ... to do a one night performance at Stationers Hall. The performance piece was inspired by my wall drawing. I wanted to recreate the sonic, repetitive atmosphere, I was drawn to when I created the wall drawing. Calasetta Calling was a 3 hour durational performance.}
