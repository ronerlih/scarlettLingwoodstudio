       I began developing my own drawing style in my A level year taking art. In my foundation year at Camberwell College of Art - I completed my first large scale drawing. In this drawing I experimented with perforating paper. I was very much drawn to the texture of what the back of the paper felt like and the abstract pattern that was created.

		  </span>
		  </p>

		  During my foundation year, I also began experimenting with a overhead projector. The overhead projector is a tool that I use to trace objects onto paper and reflect objects on the wall. The overhead projector also enables me to explore focus and scale. These large scale drawings very much explore my interest in color, texture, nature and mapping. When I create large scale works, I find myself thinking about the difference in scale between my body and the paper and the challenge that comes with creating work much larger than me.
